## Prompts completed

* 1st Jan - Triple nested loop

"Triple nested loop" makes me think of escape time fractals such as the Mandelbrot fractal, 
as they loop over the x coordinates, the y coordinates, then the iterations of the equation.

I didn't have time to implement an interface for zooming / panning / etc, 
so I added a dropdown select box with a few pre-set values for interesting Mandelbrot and Julia fractals.

* 2nd Jan - Rule 30 (elementary cellular automaton)

A straightforward implementation of a cellular automaton, using rule 30.
